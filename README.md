# Stable-Diffusion
The goal of this project is to work with Stable Diffusion as a library integrated into the [Huggingface diffusers library](https://huggingface.co/blog/stable_diffusion).
Our goal is to use a text-to-image model and apply our changes to the desired library.
This notebook is taken from [this repo](https://github.com/fastai/diffusion-nbs) in which we have applied our desired changes.

you can find Codes and Discriptions [here](https://github.com/hamedtajik/Stable-Diffusion/blob/main/Stable_Diffusion_dictators.ipynb)
